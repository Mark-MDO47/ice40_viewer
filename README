This project aims to develop a tool to graphically view a
place-n-routed ICE40 configuration, showing the exact placement of
every signal and logic gates.


Installation/usage: Dump the files somewhere accessible through a web
server, and open ice40_viewer.html in a browser.

One really simple way, useful for development, is to use Python's
SimpleHTTPServer. Simply run it from the directory containing the
source files:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then the tool is available as http://localhost:8000/ice40_viewer.html
