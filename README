This project aims to develop a tool to graphically view a
place-n-routed ICE40 configuration, showing the exact placement of
every signal and logic gates. It reads the *.asc files that are also
used as input to icepack to generate the final bitstream.

This is still work in progress, and some connections are not shown,
particularly in IO and BRAM tiles. And currently, only 8K chips are
supperted. Still, it should already be quite functional.


The latest version is hosted on github.io for easy access:

  https://knielsen.github.io/ice40_viewer/ice40_viewer.html

See the bottom of the page (below the canvas display) for instructions.

Local Installation/usage: Dump the files somewhere accessible through
a web server, and open ice40_viewer.html in a browser.

One really simple way, useful for development, is to use Python's
SimpleHTTPServer. Simply run it from the directory containing the
source files:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then the tool is available as http://localhost:8000/ice40_viewer.html
