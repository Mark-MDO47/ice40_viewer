This project aims to develop a tool to graphically view a
place-n-routed ICE40 configuration, showing the exact placement of
every signal and logic gates.


The latest version is hosted on github.io for easy access:

  https://knielsen.github.io/ice40_viewer/ice40_viewer.html

There is a file upload at the bottom of the page where a *.asc file
can be uploaded and displayed. Only hx8k devices are supported for
now.

Use the mouse-wheel to zoom in and out; click+drag the mouse to pan.
The HOME key resets the zoom.


Local Installation/usage: Dump the files somewhere accessible through
a web server, and open ice40_viewer.html in a browser.

One really simple way, useful for development, is to use Python's
SimpleHTTPServer. Simply run it from the directory containing the
source files:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then the tool is available as http://localhost:8000/ice40_viewer.html
